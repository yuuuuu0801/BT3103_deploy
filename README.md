TeamUP provides customisable and analytical team formation solutions to both NUS students and staff.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before you start:

1. Download and install Python3

2. Install the required Python3 libraries:

```bash
pip install, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
```

## Deployment

You can visit and use the fully deployed, live page at either:
1. https://yuuuuu0801.github.io/BT3103_deploy/
or:
2. https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/bt3103deploy/BT3103_deploy/index.html

## Things to Note:
Occasionally, the Course Info pages (demographics and timeline) are not fully loaded and connected to the database.
A simple refresh would normally do away with this connection issue.
